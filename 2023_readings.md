To facilitate discussions among members of the RCN, we have set up Slack channel at [evolvingseas.slack.com](https://evolvingseas.slack.com).

To join the channel please [visit this site](https://join.slack.com/t/evolvingseas/shared_invite/zt-6qomho5f-TR75xoF25rgqKzqf5OxbUg).  We encourage you to discuss the papers with other participants prior to joining the larger discussion on slack. For each topic, your group should choose one person to post a summary to the Slack channel that summarizes the group’s reaction to the papers and discussion questions. We have made efforts to improve representation and diversity in our selected readings. Please scroll to the bottom of this page for a diversity summary. Please contact [Nicolas Lou](nicolas931010@berkeley.edu) if you encounter problems with Slack or accessing any of the readings.

To form a discussion group: 1) Start a group at your home institution and meet once or twice during each two-week period (any time during the two weeks is fine) to read and discuss the papers, 2) Discuss papers virtually before joining the larger discussion via the #2022-spring-readings group on the RCN Slack. 

### Navigating Slack

All participants can use the thread feature in Slack to post additional questions, and react to comments or questions posed by other groups. We will also have a weekly thread dedicated to resolving questions that emerge from the readings. Moderators will monitor threads and respond to questions. We encourage individuals or groups to use these threads to clarify any uncertainties. 

Under `Channels` click the `+` and search for `2023-spring-readings`

Each week will have two threads: 
  * Under the thread `Week X. <Topic Name> Post your group's discussions here,` click on the chat icon `Reply to thread` to post a summary of your group's discussions.
  * To ask a question about the papers, use the thread `Week X. Questions for Understanding.` If you have any technical questions about the papers, post them here and the moderators will do their best to answer them!

# Applications of genomic tools for conservation intervention

Our fifth set of coordinated readings focuses on proactive conservation interventions. As we are facing a looming biodiversity crisis, conventional conservation strategies often seem insufficient and more proactive or even radical practices are needed. How can we use the rapidly evolving genomic toolbox to guide these conservation interventions?

As always, a central goal of the RCN-ECS is to synthesize and integrate ideas about evolution in changing seas. Therefore the final week is for groups to gather together, synthesize previous discussions, and provide answers to the four questions. We encourage groups to generate bold and testable predictions and to distance themselves from simply summarizing past discussions.

This year's papers were selected by [Camille Rumberger](https://sites.google.com/site/katielotterhos/people?pli=1#h.1zk9vvawn8sx), [Mikhail Matz](https://matzlab.weebly.com/), and [Nicolas Lou](https://www.sudmantlab.org/people.html). [Brendan Reid](https://nerdbrained.wixsite.com/home) led a team to facilitate interactions among participants from different institutions. We are grateful to [Nina Overgaard Therkildsen](https://www.therkildsenlab.com/) who came up with this year's theme, as well as the broader RCN community for their efforts in generating topics, discussion questions, and scientific papers.
