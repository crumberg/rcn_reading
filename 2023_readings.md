# Applications of genetic tools for conservation intervention

Our fifth set of coordinated readings focuses on conservation interventions. As we are facing a looming biodiversity crisis, conventional conservation strategies (e.g. endangered species list, protected areas, catch limits) often seem woefully insufficient and more proactive or even radical practices are increasingly being considered. How can we use the rapidly evolving genetic and genomic toolbox to guide these conservation interventions?

This year's papers were selected by [Camille Rumberger](https://sites.google.com/site/katielotterhos/people?pli=1#h.1zk9vvawn8sx), [Mikhail Matz](https://matzlab.weebly.com/), and [Nicolas Lou](https://www.sudmantlab.org/people.html). [Brendan Reid](https://nerdbrained.wixsite.com/home) led a team that developed strategies to facilitate interactions among participants from different institutions. We are grateful to [Nina Overgaard Therkildsen](https://www.therkildsenlab.com/) for coming up with this year's theme, as well as the broader RCN community for their efforts in generating topics, discussion questions, and scientific papers.

## Logistics

#### Forming a discussion group

We encourage you to discuss the papers with a smaller group of participants prior to joining the larger RCN reading group community on Slack. You can either form a local discussion group at your home instutition or join an online group. Your group may choose to meet either once every week or every two weeks at any time of the week. If you need helping forming or connecting to a reading group, please contact [Nicolas Lou](nicolas931010@berkeley.edu). 

> (or does someone else want to coordinate this?)

#### Reading schedule

We divided our readings into six general topics that fall under the general theme of the applications of genetic tools in conservation intervention. For each topic, there will be two main papers (in bold), and two supplementary papers that provide additional background to the topic. We will spend two weeks per topic, so if your group meet weekly, you can read one main paper per week and scan the supplemenary papers depending on your interest. If your group meet biweekly, we have chosen one out of the two main papers that we recommend you to focus on for each topic. 

#### Navigating Slack 

> this part needs to be updated with this year's activity)

To facilitate discussions among members of the RCN, we have set up a Slack channel at [evolvingseas.slack.com](https://evolvingseas.slack.com). To join the channel please [visit this site](https://join.slack.com/t/evolvingseas/shared_invite/zt-6qomho5f-TR75xoF25rgqKzqf5OxbUg). Then, under `Channels`, click the `+` and search for `2023-spring-readings`.

For each topic, your group should choose one person to post a summary to the Slack channel that summarizes the group’s reaction to the papers and discussion questions. 

All participants can use the thread feature in Slack to post additional questions, and react to comments or questions posed by other groups. We will also have a weekly thread dedicated to resolving questions that emerge from the readings. Moderators will monitor threads and respond to questions. We encourage individuals or groups to use these threads to clarify any uncertainties. 

Each week will have two threads: 
  * Under the thread `Week X. <Topic Name> Post your group's discussions here,` click on the chat icon `Reply to thread` to post a summary of your group's discussions.
  * To ask a question about the papers, use the thread `Week X. Questions for Understanding.` If you have any technical questions about the papers, post them here and the moderators will do their best to answer them!

Please contact [Nicolas Lou](nicolas931010@berkeley.edu) if you encounter problems with Slack or accessing any of the readings.
